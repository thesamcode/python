# Object Oriented programming

- classes
    - constructor
    - attributes
    - methods
    -self

self is targeting an instance of a class
## Class
What is a class?
- blueprint

## constructor
- magic method
def \_\_init__()
this returns an instance of th emethod

## Attributes
`distinguishing characteristics of the object`
`the things that make up and object`
- make
- model
- color
- price
- number of seats
- number of doors

# Methods
`performs some action on the object`
is functions inside of classes
- drive 
- turn on
- turn off
- lock
- increase odometer -> distance

## self
`refers to instance of the object`
